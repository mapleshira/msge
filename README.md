mapleshira Static Gallery Editor, Python GUI tool for generating .JSON files for use on static website image galleries.

copy_art_collection is a folder of old artwork of mine, free to use it to test out the tool.

experimental_js_gallery is an old and stripped down gallery reader for a previous format of the .JSON generated by the Python program.

Note! This is an alpha build, version 01. It is prone to crashing and has little to no error handling if you feed it a wrong file or a directory not full of images.
