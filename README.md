mapleshira Static Gallery Editor, Python GUI tool for generating .JSON files for use on static website image galleries.

copy_art_collection is a folder of old artwork of mine, free to use to test out the tool.

Note! This is an alpha build, version 01. It is prone to crashing and has little to no error handling if you feed it a wrong file or a directory not full of images.
